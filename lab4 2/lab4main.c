/*
 * Name: Pavan Thota
 *Problem/Approach: The program that I was needing to make was a an inventory
 * system where it manages the business records and items and profits.
 * allows the user to get through and create the inventory and have an input file
 * and an output file to store results in. The implementation uses singly linked lists
 * and structures and pointers and makes sure no memory allocation is leftover or no leaks
 * using the valgrind software.
